Munich has many sights worth visiting, and one of those places is the English Garden. With 375 hectares, it is one of the largest parks in the world. In the southern part of the park there are two large brooks, the Eisbach and the Schwabinger Bach, whose branches form a complex brook system. In addition to the charming landscapes and untouched nature, the park offers a variety of attractions and interesting excursion destinations. The English garden plays a major role in the life of the city.

We asked ourselves the question: How can Munich residents and tourists best get to know the park? How could knowledge about the English Garden be conveyed?

A worthy option can be a scavenger hunt game based on AR technology. All the user needs is a smartphone with a camera and internet access. In this way he can find out facts about important places in the park in an entertaining way, see them with his own eyes and have a good time.

In the course of the scavenger hunt, the player is taken to 7 locations. Knowledge about the places should be built into the story through dialogues. The following is a brief summary of the story and the interaction options.
