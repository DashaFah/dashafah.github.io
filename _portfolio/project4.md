A game for two players. You will need a sheet of paper, preferably in a cage, and a couple of pens of different colors. On a sheet of paper, a playing field is drawn in size from 3 * 3 squares, and more (up to 9 * 9), depending on the level of the players. The essence of the game: the players take turns drawing one-square-long lines, trying to create 1 by 1 squares inside the field. If your line has become the final one in the square, put your sign in it and get the right of an additional move. The moves continue until you place a line that does not complete any square. The game ends when the entire field is full. After that, the number of squares closed by each player is counted and the winner is announced.
