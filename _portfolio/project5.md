2300 year. A huge meteorite fell on the Earth, because of which the Earth fell apart into thousands of pieces. Each of the players in the two groups of lucky ones hid in the bunker, but when each of them came out, he stepped on only the shards of his native planet. It is not known who survived and how far other parts of the Earth are.

After some time they discover each other's settlement. However, they do not intend to be friends. The resources of each of the settlements are running out. But they are completely against it. After all, the remaining resources are limited and new ones will have to be produced by each of their own labor.

Players were elected leaders in their settlements. Now their task is to build a new world on the fragments of a prosperous civilization.

Since the Earth's civilization is lost, the fragments of the planet have acquired their natural and wild appearance - each of the 4 fragments is a single natural zone: a jungle, a snowy desert, a sandy desert and a swamp.

Each player has resources (food, fuel) and energy (physical strength). The movement on the ground consumes energy. Energy can be restored at the expense of resources.

Players can capture and ennoble the land, but this also requires resources.

At the beginning of the game, players are at the start. Each has 10 energy units and 500 units of resources. For the turn, the player must roll the dice. Each step on the map takes 1 unit of energy. When the energy ends, the character stops and has no way to go further. The turn moves to another player. To resume the movement, the player needs to buy energy for resources.
Players can buy territories for resources. If you hit someone else's territory, the player must pay the rent.
The game ends when one of the players run out of resources.
